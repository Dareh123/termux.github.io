A Termux security incident response will normally have the following `5` phases.

- [Phase 1: Initial Assessment and Validation](#phase-1-initial-assessment-and-validation)
- [Phase 2: Immediate Response and Mitigation](#phase-2-immediate-response-and-mitigation)
- [Phase 3: Impact Assessment and User Analysis](#phase-3-impact-assessment-and-user-analysis)
- [Phase 4: Communication and Release](#phase-4-communication-and-release)
- [Phase 5: Post-Incident Review](#phase-5-post-incident-review)

## Phase 1: Initial Assessment and Validation

### Updates

<< Use this section to detail the report received, initial assessment, and validation results. >>

Example:

I have reviewed the security report and confirmed this vulnerability exists in termux component or package FOOBAR.

Assessment of exploitability:

- Attack complexity: [High/Medium/Low]
- Prerequisites: [Authentication required/Network access/Specific configuration/etc]
- User interaction required: [Yes/No]

Potential impact:
- User data confidentiality: [At risk/Not affected]
- Termux VPS integrity: [At risk/Not affected]
- Estimated affected installations: [Number/Percentage]

### Resources

- [Termux Security Policy](https://termux.dev/security)
- [CVE Scoring Calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)

### Tasks

- [ ] Reproduce the vulnerability in test environment.
- [ ] Assess CVSS score and severity level.
- [ ] Check if vulnerability affects current stable release.
- [ ] Check if vulnerability affects current beta release (if applicable).
- [ ] Determine if this requires immediate action or can wait for next release cycle.
- [ ] Document technical details and root cause.

### Assessment Summary

- **Severity Level**: `Critical|High|Medium|Low`
- **CVSS Score**: `X.X`
- **Affects versions**: `X.Y.Z to X.Y.Z`
- **Root cause**: Brief technical explanation

Example:

Working on hotfix for component FOOBAR version X.Y.Z. Temporary workaround available by removing/disabling [feature/package].

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement immediate workaround if possible.
- [ ] Update security advisory draft.
- [ ] Prepare patch/hotfix.
- [ ] Test fix thoroughly in development environment.
- [ ] Prepare updated Docker images and binaries.
- [ ] Draft security advisory for GitHub Security Advisories.
- [ ] Consider if coordinated disclosure timeline needs adjustment.

### Mitigation Details

- **Workaround available**: `Yes|No` - If yes, describe briefly
- **Fix implemented on**: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Patch/hotfix version**: `vX.Y.Z`
- **GitHub Security Advisory ID**: `GHSA-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`

## Phase 3: Impact Assessment and User Analysis

### Updates

<< Analysis of potential impact on the Termux deployments. >>

Based on app-download statistics from F-Droid, or package download statistics from VPS, approximately X installations may be affected.

### Tasks

- [ ] Estimate number of vulnerable installations.
- [ ] Assess if default configurations are vulnerable.
- [ ] If possible, review if vulnerability has been exploited (check logs etc).
- [ ] Determine if any user data may have been compromised.
- [ ] Check for indicators of active exploitation in the wild.

### Analysis Notes

_Document your impact assessment process and findings._

### Impact Summary

- **Estimated vulnerable installations**: `~X out of Y`
- **Default configuration vulnerable**: `Yes|No`
- **Evidence of exploitation**: `Found|Not found|Unknown`
- **User data potentially at risk**: `Email content|Credentials|Keys|Configuration|None`
- **Confidence in assessment**: `High|Medium|Low`
